Introduction:
My website is a digital gaming magazine. It provides news about different video games and game reviews. There is a main page which has the most important news. From it you can go to the pages with more news which are represented as cards, on which you can click and go to the news article. There are also pages with reviews which are located separately. If you click on one of the review cards from these pages, you are transferred to the respective review article.

Inspiration:
I get news related to the video gaming industry from different sources and websites, therefore it is hard for me to provide an example of a website which inspired me the most. There were a vast number of gaming websites which I used in my life and my experience in this sphere was part of the reason why I did such a website. 
However if I really need to highlight something that inspired me to make such a site, then it will be IGN. Their youtube channel and a website are really cool and I definitely took inspiration from them to make my website. 
The last reason why I made a website with a video gaming theme is that my friend said that it would be a good idea to make such a website as he knows that I am quite knowledgeable about how it should look like. 

Accessibility:
As my website is responsive, it scales in size quite well. If for someone for example who has a visual impairment font is too small they can zoom in and the website will still have a convenient layout and styling. This ensures that they can comfortably read and engage with the site's content.
I strived to make my website user-friendly for everyone. Therefore, I maintained clear navigation menus and consistent page layouts, making it easier for individuals with cognitive disabilities or those who rely on assistive technologies to navigate and understand the structure of my site.
I provide alternative text descriptions for all my images. This helps individuals with visual impairments understand the structure of pages with images using screen readers or other assistive technologies.

Usability:
I have a clear and user-friendly navigation structure. Page number navigation at the bottom, header and footer having links to other parts of the website. This allows visitors to easily find the information they are looking for. 
The website is optimized for different devices and screen sizes. It will be convenient to use in desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. Website is conveniently usable for almost every screen.
The website has different useful features such as: two versions of news cards, sort modes for reviews, a load more button. All of this makes the website easy to use for any purpose.

Learning:
I had to learn how to use js scripts for interaction with html and css files. I watched videos from my course but it was not enough so to get more information I used the internet. Youtube video lessons helped me a lot.
To make my site responsive, I had to learn more about @media tag in css. It was not too hard, so basically youtube video tutorials were enough to get all necessary information.
In my project, I used Handlebars a lot for templating part of every page, therefore I had to learn how to write code with it. At first using this library was quite weird but with time I got used to it, again mainly watching youtube video tutorials.

Evaluation I:
The part that I am most proud of in my project is Handlebars. At first I did almost everything without it and my project was huge. There were a lot of html pages which were very similar to each other and their main difference was in the data which they used. Then I decided to use Handlebars for templating pages and it drastically changed my website code. Code became neat and efficient looking. I spent a lot of time trying to make Handlebars work but when I finished, the project looked much more professional than before. Furthermore, the use of templates allowed me to make page navigation better in terms of code. Again, I had to spend a lot of time fixing bugs before it worked as intended but the final result was worth it.

Evaluation II:
In my project, I am not satisfied with two things. First, despite that I said that I like how page navigation looks in terms of code, it is still not ideal. Feature with load more button makes everything quite hard to control. I feel that code which I now have is not really scalable and will not work for 5 or 10 review pages. Second, I do not particularly like the design of my website. I am not an artist or experienced web designer, so I guess it is ok that I have not the coolest looking site. However, in the future projects I will try to make websites look better.
